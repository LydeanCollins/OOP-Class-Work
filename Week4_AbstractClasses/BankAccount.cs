     * Abstract classes (Characteristics)
     * - abstract class BankAccount
     * - class cannot be instantiated - you cannot create an object 
     * - there to be inherited like an interface
     * - an abstract class can inherit an interface like a normal class
     * - notation: public abstract returntype MethodName(....);
     * - you can also additional properties
     * -
     * 
     * Abstract vs Interfaces (differences)
     * - An Abstract class can hold implemented methods/properties AND also ABSTRACT components
     * - an abstract class can have a PRIVATE constructor where to instantiate other objects
     * - You can also inherit from ONE abstract class but you can inherit from MULTIPLE interfaces
